# PING-PONG-GAME.
This is a simple Ping Pong game built using Python and Pygame. The player controls a paddle to bounce a moving ball and prevent it from falling. The ball bounces off walls and the paddle, earning points each hit. The game improves reflexes and demonstrates basic game concepts like movement, collision, and scoring.
